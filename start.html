      <p class="center-aligned contrast-color">The answer is: <strong>Both are equally likely!!</strong></p>
      <p>The <strong>Martingale system</strong>, advocated by many dubious gurus, would have you believe that 2. is a more likely
        sequence than 1. In reality, both are <strong>equally likely</strong> (1 out of 16). Each outcome has no &quot;memory&quot;
        of the previous one. There is no magical karma balancing out the state of the universe to make
        <strong>red</strong> eventually more likely to appear.
      </p>
      <p>
        Coupled with the fact that there is always a credit limit, the Martingale system will give you some wins that will eventually
        lead to catastrophical losses.
